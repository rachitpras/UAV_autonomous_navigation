In this article, I will discuss the architecture of the trajectory tracking controller used in my autonomous UAV navigation project. Please refer to the main article for more information regarding the autonomous navigation project. The goal of a trajectory tracking controller is to determine the appropriate control actuation that will enable the ego-vehicle to track the planned trajectory generated by the motion planner. Since, we are working with quadrotors, the control acutuation is in the form the speed of the four propellors. Based on our literature survey, two different control architectures were experimented with. The first was PID based and the second was Model Predictive Control (MPC) based.
